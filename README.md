# GuestKeeper

**GuestKeeper** is a user-friendly reservation management application built with **Angular**. It allows users to create, edit, delete, and view guest reservations efficiently. All data is stored locally using the browser‚Äôs **localStorage**, making it lightweight and simple to deploy without a backend. Additionally, a **Mock API** powered by **Mockoon** is used to simulate backend operations such as PUT, DELETE, UPDATE, GET, and GET by ID.
